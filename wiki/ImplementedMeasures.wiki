#labels Phase-Design,Featured,measures

The JIDT implements a range of information-theoretic measures, for both _discrete_ and _continuous_-valued.

The measures (and estimation techniques) implemented by this toolkit are as follows

|| *Measure* || *Discrete* || *Continuous* (implementation technique specified) ||
|| *Entropy* || yes || (box) kernel estimation`*`, Kozachenko`*`, Gaussian`*` ||
|| *Entropy rate* || yes || _Use two multivariate entropy calculators_ ||
|| *Mutual information* || yes || (box) kernel estimation`*`+, Kozachenko, Kraskov`*`+, Symbolic`*`+, Gaussian`*`+||
|| *Conditional mutual information* ||   || Kraskov`*`+, Symbolic`*`+ ||
|| *Multi-information / Integration* || yes || (box) kernel estimation`*`, Kraskov`*` ||
|| *Transfer Entropy* || yes || (box) kernel estimation`*`, Kraskov estimation`*`, Symbolic ||
|| *Conditional/Complete Transfer Entropy* || yes || _Use multivariate conditional MI calculators_ ||
|| *Active information storage* || yes || (box) kernel estimation ||
|| *Excess entropy / predictive information* || yes || _Use multivariate MI calculators_ ||
|| *Separable information* || yes ||  ||

Key to table:
  * `*` indicates multivariate (i.e. joint state) implementation is provided.<br/>
  * + also implements MI from multivariate continuous variables to a discrete variable
