= Cellular Automata demos =

This demonstration set shows how to compute local information dynamics profiles in (1D) [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton cellular automata] (CAs).

It is written for Matlab or Octave.

This demonstration set is found at [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2Foctave%2FCellularAutomata demos/octave/CellularAutomata/] in the svn or full distribution.

= Code design =

{{{plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA.m}}} is the main file, which you call supplying arguments specifying the CA, and which local information dynamics measure to profile:
{{{
% function plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA(neighbourhood, base, rule, cells, timeSteps, measureId, measureParams, options)
% 
% Plot one run of the given CA and compute and plot a local information dynamics profile for it
%
% Inputs:
% - neighbourhood - neighbourhood size for the rule (ECA has neighbourhood 3).
%     For an even size neighbourhood (meaning a different number of neighbours on each side of the cell),
%     we take an extra cell from the lower cell indices (i.e. from the left).
% - base - number of discrete states for each cell (for binary states this is 2)
% - rule - supplied as either:
%     a. an integer rule number if <= 2^31 - 1 (Wolfram style; e.g. 110, 54 are the complex ECA rules)
%     b. a HEX string, e.g. phi_par from Mitchell et al. is "0xfeedffdec1aaeec0eef000a0e1a020a0" (note: the leading 0x is not required)
% - cells - number of cells in the CA
% - timeSteps - number of rows to execute the CA for (including the random initial row)
% - measureId - which local info dynamics measure to plot - can be a string or an integer as follows:
%    - "active", 0 - active information storage (requires measureParams.k)
%    - "transfer", 1 - apparent transfer entropy (requires measureParams.k and j)
%    - "transfercomplete", 2 - complete transfer entropy (requires measureParams.k and j)
%    - "separable", 3 - separable information (requires measureParams.k)
%    - "all", -1 - plot all measures
% - measureParams - a structure containing options as described for each measure above:
%    - measureParams.k - history length for information dynamics measures
%    - measureParams.j - we measure information transfer across j cells to the right per time step
% - options - a stucture containing a range of other options, i.e.:
%    - plotOptions - structure as defined for the plotRawCa function
%    - seed - state for the random number generator used to set the initial condition of the CA (use this
%       for reproducibility of plots, or to produce profiles for several different measures of the same CA raw states).
%       We set rand("state", options.seed) if options.seed is supplied, and restore the previous seed afterwards.
%    - plotRawCa - default true
%    - saveImages - whether to save the plots or not (default false)
%    - movingFrameSpeed - to investigate a moving frame of reference (default 0) (as in Lizier & Mahoney paper)

Several scripts are available demonstrating how to call {{{plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA.m}}} to generate the desired figures; see:

Mahoney, "Moving frames of reference, relativity and invariance in transfer entropy and information dynamics", Entropy, vol. *15*, no. 1, p. 177-197, 2013; doi: [http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e15010177 10.3390/e15010177]

In brief, the steps that these scripts demonstrate are as follows:

Make sure that the jar location is entered correctly in {{{plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA.m}}}

Set up the {{{measureParams}}} and {{{options}}} structures, e.g.:
{{{
measureParams.k = 16; % History length of 16 for info dynamics measures
options.plotOptions.plotRows = 100; % plot only 100 rows
options.plotOptions.plotCols = 100; % plot only 100 columns
options.plotOptions.plotStartRow = 100; % plot from row 100 onwards
options.plotOptions.plotStartCol = 100; % plot from column 100 onwards
}}}

Then call to plot a CA and a given local information dynamics profile, e.g. for ECA rule 54 and plotting local active information storage:
{{{
plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA(3, 2, 54, 10000, 600, "active", measureParams, options);
}}}
with sample results as follows:

Or for the neighbourhood 7 rule \phi_par from Mitchell et al. (see this [http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/evca-review.pdf paper]):
{{{
measureParams.k = 10; % History length of 10 for info dynamics measures
options.plotOptions.plotRows = 100; % plot only 100 rows
options.plotOptions.plotCols = 100; % plot only 100 columns
options.plotOptions.plotStartRow = 10; % plot from row 100 onwards
options.plotOptions.plotStartCol = 100; % plot from column 100 onwards

plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA(7, 2, "feedffdec1aaeec0eef000a0e1a020a0", 10000, 1000, "active", measureParams, options);
}}}
with sample results as follows:

<img src="http://lizier.me/joseph/images/jidt/phiPar-rawStates.png" height="300"/> <img src="http://lizier.me/joseph/images/jidt/phiPar-activeInfoStorage.png" height="300"/>

To make several local information profiles for the one CA run (with the same initial CA state for each plot), set {{{options.seed}}} to a fixed value, and call {{{plotLocalInfoMeasureForCA}}} for each measure separately.
