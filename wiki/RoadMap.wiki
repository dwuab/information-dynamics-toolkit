= Introduction =

This page lays out the new features I plan on including in the toolkit, and their priority (OK, so this is more of a placeholder than anything else ...).

= New features planned =

New features to be implemented:

Release 0.2:
 # Alter !TransferEntropyCalculatorKraskov to use a single Kraskov estimator in the joint space - Issue 3
 # Implement an abstract !TransferEntropyCalculatorMultiVariate which makes use of a concrete implementation of !ConditionalMutualInformationCalculatorMultiVariate to make the calculations.
 # Alter !MutualInfoCalculatorMultiVariate significance calculations to specify which variable should be reordered - Issue 4

Low priority / later:
 # `main()` function on as many calculators as possible, taking in file references for data, and the main parameters, and return the value of the calculation to standard output. Have a new `demos/java/calculationScripts/` directory with shell scripts to call these calculations on demo data files.

TODO - evaluate other Issues ...
