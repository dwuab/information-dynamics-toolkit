= Demos =

Several sets of demonstration code are distributed with the toolkit. Links to their wiki pages and their location in the distribution are given below:
  * SimpleJavaExamples -- `demos/java` -- a set of basic examples using the Java toolkit;
  * Several demo sets mirror the `SimpleJavaExamples` to demonstrate the use of the toolkit in non-Java environments:
   * OctaveMatlabExamples -- `demos/octave` -- basic examples on using the Java toolkit from Octave or Matlab environments;
   * PythonExamples -- `demos/python` -- basic examples on using the Java toolkit from Python using the JPype interface;
   * [R_Examples] -- `demos/r` -- basic examples on using the Java toolkit from R using the rJava interface;
  * SchreiberTeDemos -- `demos/octave/SchreiberTransferEntropyExamples` -- using the toolkit to reproduce the transfer entropy examples originally included in Schreiber's 2000 paper introducing transfer entropy;
  * CellularAutomataDemos -- `demos/octave/CellularAutomata` -- using the Java toolkit to plot local information dynamics profiles in cellular automata; the demo is run under Octave or Matlab;
  * DetectingInteractionLags -- `demos/octave/DetectingInteractionLags` -- demonstration of using the transfer entropy with source-destination lags; the demo is run under Octave or Matlab;
  * InterregionalTransfer -- `demos/java/interregionalTransfer` -- higher level example using collective transfer entropy to infer effective connections between "regions" of data;
  * NullDistributions -- `demos/octave/NullDistributions` -- investigating the correspondence between analytic and bootstrapped distributions for TE and MI under null hypotheses of no relationship; the demo is run under Octave or Matlab;

You can also review the [JUnitTestCases] -- the test cases for the Java toolkit included in the distribution -- these case also be browsed to see simple use cases for the toolkit.

= Extras = 

You may also be interested in several [Extras extra] features that the toolkit has (in addition to the information dynamics calculators); e.g. Octave text file format reading and writing, matrix manipulation, mathematical functions, etc.
