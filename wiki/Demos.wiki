= Demos =

Several sets of demonstration code are distributed with the toolkit:
  * SimpleJavaExamples - basic examples using the Java toolkit;
  * OctaveMatlabExamples - basic examples on using the Java toolkit from Octave or Matlab environments - these mirror the SimpleJavaExamples;
  * PythonExamples - basic examples on using the Java toolkit from Python using the JPype interface - these mirror the SimpleJavaExamples;
  * CellularAutomataDemos - using the Java toolkit to plot local information dynamics profiles in cellular automata; the toolkit is run under Octave or Matlab;
  * SchreiberTeDemos - using the toolkit to reproduce the transfer entropy examples originally included in Schreiber's 2000 paper introducing transfer entropy;
  * InterregionalTransfer - higher level example using collective transfer entropy to infer effective connections between "regions" of data;
  * [JUnitTestCases] - the test cases for the Java toolkit are included in the distribution - these case also be browsed to see simple use cases for the toolkit;
  * More coming soon ...
