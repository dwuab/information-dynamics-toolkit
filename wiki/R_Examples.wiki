This page describes a basic set of demonstration scripts for using the toolkit in R. The .r files can be found at [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2Fr demos/r] in the svn or main distributions (from V1.1 release).

Please see UseInR for instructions on how to begin using the java toolkit from inside R.

Note that these examples use [http://jpype.sourceforge.net/ JPype] -- you will need to alter them if you want to use another Python-Java interface.

This page contains the following code examples:
  * [#Example_1_-_Transfer_entropy_on_binary_data Example 1 - Transfer entropy on binary data]
  * [#Example_2_-_Transfer_entropy_on_multidimensional_binary_data Example 2 - Transfer entropy on multidimensional binary data]
  * [#Example_3_-_Transfer_entropy_on_continuous_data_using_kernel_est Example 3 - Transfer entropy on continuous data using kernel estimators]
  * [#Example_4_-_Transfer_entropy_on_continuous_data_using_Kraskov_es Example 4 - Transfer entropy on continuous data using Kraskov estimators]
  * [#Example_5_-_Multivariate_transfer_entropy_on_binary_data Example 5 - Multivariate transfer entropy on binary data]

Install rJava http://www.rforge.net/rJava/ 
Run `install.packages("rJava")` in R.
See further installation notes at http://www.rforge.net/rJava/ if required (e.g. to enable Java in R)

Installation is failing this way ...

Trying to install via ubuntu package manager -- recommended on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311940/r-rjava-package-install-failing that this solves some issues that installing from within R does not

Got some errors on trying to load rJava.

So 
Ran `sudo R CMD javareconf` in my shell.
Library loaded ok after that.

Didn't need to clear JAVA_HOME as some pages suggest.

Gotchas:
- classpath must be a full path, as it seems to be relative to the location of rJava
- integer arguments to methods need to be passed as 1L etc

See http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/rJava.pdf for further help
