= Introduction =

The java code from this toolkit can easily be used in Python.
First we describe calling java code from Python, then specifically describe the use of this toolkit

= Using Java objects in Python =

There are several alternatives for using Java objects in Python, e.g. [http://jpype.sourceforge.net/ JPype] and [http://www.jython.org Jython].

Here, we focus on using JPype for several reasons, including:
 * It is run as an import to ordinary python code in the standard interpreter (jython runs as an alternative python interpreter)
 * It is packaged for ubuntu (which is my platform of choice) as `python-jpype`
