= Introduction =

Here we describe how to install and start using the toolkit (it's pretty simple!)

= Download =

Download the latest distribution; either (note: these distributions are suitable for all platforms):
 # [http://lizier.me/joseph/software/jidt/download.php?file=infodynamics-dist-0.2.0.zip full distribution] (includes jar file, javadocs, demonstrations, unit tests and build scripts); or
 # [http://lizier.me/joseph/software/jidt/download.php?file=infodynamics-jar-0.2.0.zip jar file] alone (better only if you don't need much guidance on how to use the toolkit);
 # full source code via SVN - see http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/checkout

See all distributions and brief descriptions at [Downloads].

= Dependencies =

None! You don't need any other downloads to start using this code (unless you want to rebuild or run the JUnit test cases - see [JUnitTestCases])

There are only dependencies if:
 # You don't have java installed - download it from [http://www.java.com/]
 # You wish to (re-)build the project using the build.xml script - this requires [http://ant.apache.org/ ant]
 # You wish to run the JUnit test cases - this requires [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit] - for how to run JUnit with our ant script see [JUnitTestCases]

= Install =

If you have one of the distributions, you already have the {{{infodynamics.jar}}} file.

Otherwise, if you are running with the source code via an SVN checkout, run {{{ant}}} to generate {{{infodynamics.jar}}}.

Then just put the jar in a relevant location in your file structure.

That's it.

= Usage =

See [Demos] for some guided examples on using the code, including OctaveMatlabExamples.
