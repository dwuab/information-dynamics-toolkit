= Introduction =

Here we describe how to install and start using the toolkit (it's pretty simple!)

= Download =

Download the latest distribution; either:
 # [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=infodynamics-jar-0.1.1.zip jar file] alone;
 # [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=infodynamics-dist-0.1.1.zip full distribution] (includes jar file, javadocs, demonstrations, unit tests and build scripts); or
 # full source code via SVN - see http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/checkout

= Dependencies =

None! You don't need any other downloads to start using this code (unless you want to run the JUnit test cases - see JUnitTestCases)

= Install =

If you have one of the distributions, you already have the{{{infodynamics.jar}}} file.

Otherwise, if you are running with the source code via an SVN checkout, run {{{ant}}} to generate {{{infodynamics.jar}}}.

Then just put the jar in a relevant location in your file structure.

That's it.

= Usage =

See [Demos] for some guided examples on using the code, including OctaveMatlabExamples.
