Here we describe how to install and start using the toolkit (it's pretty simple!)

= Download =

Download the latest distribution; either:
 # [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/downloads/detail?name=infodynamics-jar-0.1.zip jar file] alone;
 # jar file plus demonstrations <coming soon>
 # full source code via SVN - see http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/checkout

= Dependencies =

None! You don't need any other downloads to start using this code

= Install =

Just put the jar in a relevant location in your file structure.

If you have the source code, javac all of it, and make a jar.

= Usage =

See [Demos] for some guided examples on using the code, including OctaveMatlabExamples.
