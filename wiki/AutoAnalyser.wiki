= Auto Analyser Demo =

This demonstration (available from release 1.3) gives you the simplest possible way to get started with a transfer entropy calculation in JIDT.

The demo provides a GUI for you to:
 # select a *data set*,
 # select a transfer entropy *estimator*, and
 # make *parameter settings* for that estimator.
Once you have done that, the demo:
 # *Computes the transfer entropy* from that data set _without you needing to write any code_, and
 # *Generates code for you* to reproduce that calculation, in _each_ of: Java, Python and Matlab/Octave.

You have no excuses left not to use JIDT -- it is simply too easy!

This demonstration is found at [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2FAutoAnalyser demos/AutoAnalyser] in the svn or [Downloads full distribution].


== Running the Auto Analyser GUI app ==

Run the `AutoAnalyser` GUI app from the `demos/AutoAnalyser` folder via:
 # the shell script `runTEAutoAnalyser.sh` (may require `chmod u+x`), or
 # the batch file `runTEAutoAnalyser.bat` (for Windows).

This will launch the GUI app, which looks like:

[http://information-dynamics-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web/AutoAnalyserGUI-1-Launch.png] 

Next, you fill out the details for the transfer entropy calculation in the left panel, i.e.:
 # Select which TE *estimator* to use from the drop-down list
 # Select your *data file*: must be a multivariate time-series in a text file, with each row containing samples for each variable at the same time step, and time step increasing with the rows. The default location is our `demos/data` folder, which contains several sample files. Once you have selected a data set, the label beneath the `Select` button will tell you the number of rows and columns in it.
 # Indicate *which columns* of the data should be interpreted as the source and destination for the calculation (numbered starting from 0 to match Java).
 # Provide values for all the relevant *properties* of this estimator in the table. The default values for each property are provided in the table. You only need overwrite those that you wish to change. When you hover over each property, you will see a pop-up describing the property and valid values for it (see example for property `k_HISTORY` in the above picture). More details are also available in the Javadocs for the `setProperty(String, String)` method of that calculator Class.

Then, click the `Compute` button. Unless you have made an error in the above, the transfer entropy will be computed for you, and written below the `Compute` button.

Furthermore, the app will generate code to repeat this calculation using JIDT for you, in each of Java, Python and Matlab. The code is shown in the right panel; for example, see:

[http://information-dynamics-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/web/AutoAnalyserGUI-2-Compute.png] 

As you can see, there are separate tabs displaying code generated in each of Java, Python and Matlab.

== Running the generated code files ==

Generated code files are also saved for you in the location of the app (`demos/AutoAnalyser`) for Python and Matlab, and under `demos/java/infodynamics/demos/autoanalysis` for Java. You can run the generated code in each language from the `demos/AutoAnalyser` folder as follows:
 # *Java*: on the command line, run `.\runTEAutoGenerated.sh` (after `chmod u+x`) or `runTEAutoGenerated.bat`
 # *Python*: on the command line, run `python GeneratedTECalculator.py`
 # *Matlab/Octave*: start Matlab/Octave in this folder and run `GeneratedTECalculator`
You can confirm that the same result is provided by the GUI and from each of these generated programs.

== Using the GUI app to learn JIDT ==

A useful exercise to undertake when learning JIDT is to play around with the estimators and property values. Observe and try to understand the changes these selections make to the code that is generated. One thing you should notice is that property settings are only generated in the code where they are different to the default property values.
