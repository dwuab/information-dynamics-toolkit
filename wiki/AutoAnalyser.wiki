= Auto Analyser Demo =

This demonstration (available from release 1.3) gives you the simplest possible way to get started with JIDT.

The demo provides a GUI for you to:
 # select a data set,
 # select a transfer entropy estimator, and
 # make parameter settings for that estimator
And once you press `Compute` the demo:
 # Computes the transfer entropy from that data set without you needing to write any code, and
 # Generates code to reproduce that calculation for you, in Java, Python and Matlab/Octave.

You have no excuses left not to use JIDT -- it is simply too easy!

This demonstration is found at [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2FAutoAnalyser demos/AutoAnalyser] in the svn or [Downloads full distribution].


== Running the Auto Analyser GUI app ==

Run the `AutoAnalyser` GUI app from the `demos/AutoAnalyser` folder via the shell script `runTEAutoAnalyser.sh` (may require `chmod u+x`) or `runTEAutoAnalyser.bat` (for Windows).
