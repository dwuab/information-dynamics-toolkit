== 1. How can I perform multivariate calculations on discrete data sets (i.e. with int[][] data sets)? ==

Use the ordinary univariate calculator, but:
 # create it for a larger base (where the new base is the base of each single discrete variable, raised to the power of the number of joint variables that you have in the marginal), and 
 # Combine the joint vectors for the source and destination time series into single dimensional arrays before passing the observations in. I.e. if you have 2 binary values b1 and b2 as a joint vector to combine, then combine them as `b = 2*b1 * b2`, giving you a unique value for any b1,b2 combination. This can be done in one line for your multidimensional arrays by calling `combinedValues = MatrixUtils.computeCombinedValues(int separateValues[][], int base)` for each of the source and destination time series, where combinedValues is just a single dimensional time series of the combined values, separateValues is the input multivariate time series, and base is the number of discrete states for each variable in the multivariate time series (i.e. 2 for binary variables).
