WORK IN PROGRESS !!!

= Schreiber Transfer Entropy Demos =

This demonstration set shows how to recreate the examples in Schreiber's original paper introducing transfer entropy:
  * T. Schreiber, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.85.461 "Measuring Information Transfer"], Physical Review Letters 85(2): 461-464.
Several additional analyses on the same data set are provided as well.

It is written for MATLAB or Octave.

This demonstration set is found at [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2Foctave%2FSchreiberTransferEntropyExamples demos/octave/SchreiberTransferEntropyExamples/] in the svn or full distribution.
