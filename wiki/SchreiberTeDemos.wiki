= Schreiber Transfer Entropy Demos =

This demonstration set shows how to recreate the examples in Schreiber's original paper introducing transfer entropy:
  * T. Schreiber, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.85.461 "Measuring Information Transfer"], Physical Review Letters 85(2): 461-464.
Several additional analyses on the same data set are provided as well.

It is written for MATLAB or Octave.

This demonstration set is found at [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2Foctave%2FSchreiberTransferEntropyExamples demos/octave/SchreiberTransferEntropyExamples/] in the svn or full distribution.

== 1. Tent Map ==

The script [http://code.google.com/p/information-dynamics-toolkit/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fdemos%2Foctave%2FSchreiberTransferEntropyExamples/runTentMap.m runTentMap.m] recreates Figure 1 from Schreiber's TE paper.
It is run simply as follows:
{{{
teValues = runTentMap();
}}}
The script takes 15 - 30 minutes to run (for all coupling strengths and 10 repeat runs), though you can edit the number of iterates etc to make it run faster.

This script runs the Tent Map, with all parameters as described in the paper, then computes the TE from a discretization of the data.

The script finally plots the TE as a function of the coupling parameter of the Tent Map, as shown here:

Note that the line was Schreiber's line of best fit, which may not necessarily be quite the line of best fit from our run.
