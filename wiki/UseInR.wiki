#summary How to use the toolkit in R

= Introduction =

Coming soon ...

Install rJava http://www.rforge.net/rJava/ 
Run `install.packages("rJava")` in R.
See further installation notes at http://www.rforge.net/rJava/ if required (e.g. to enable Java in R)

Installation is failing this way ...

Trying to install via ubuntu package manager -- recommended on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311940/r-rjava-package-install-failing that this solves some issues that installing from within R does not: package name is `r-cran-rjava`

Got some errors on trying to load rJava.

So 
Ran `sudo R CMD javareconf` in my shell.
Library loaded ok after that.

Didn't need to clear JAVA_HOME as some pages suggest.

Gotchas:
- Make sure to set the working directory so that relative classpath can be used
- integer arguments to methods need to be passed as 1L etc

See http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/rJava.pdf for further help
